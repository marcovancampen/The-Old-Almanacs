# Changelog

All notable changes to Jen Almanac's Modpack will be documented in this file.

## [17/11/2025]

### Added

#### CryptidAlmanacCompat Integration
- **Integrated all CryptidAlmanacCompat functionality into Jen and JenLib** - The separate compatibility mod is no longer needed
  - **Cryptid Encoded Deck Support** (`JenLib.lua`): Modified encoded deck behavior to spawn only Code Joker, removing the banned Copy/Paste joker
  - **POINTER:// Blacklist System** (`JenLib.lua`): Prevents creation of Jen's custom rarities and OMEGA consumables via POINTER://
  - **P03 Dynamic Exotic Control** (`Jen.lua`): P03 joker now dynamically enables/disables Exotic joker creation in POINTER:// when added/removed from deck
  - **Gameset Override** (`JenLib.lua`): Forces "madness" gameset for all Jen cards and disables gameset selector UI
  - **Safety Wrappers** (`JenLib.lua`): Added `update_hand_text` color safety wrapper to prevent crashes

#### JenLib (`JenLib.lua`) - v0.4.1
- **Cryptid Compatibility System** - New module with comprehensive Cryptid integration functions:
  - `jl.init_cryptid_compat()` - Gameset override and config modifications
  - `jl.setup_encoded_deck()` - Takes ownership of Cryptid's Encoded deck with existence checks
  - `jl.setup_pointer_blacklist()` - Blacklists Jen custom rarities and OMEGA consumables (NOT exotics - handled by P03)
  - `jl.setup_pointer_aliases()` - Registers 40+ card name shortcuts for easy POINTER:// creation
  - `jl.wrap_update_hand_text()` - Safety wrapper for hand text updates
  - `jl.get_table_keys()` - Debug utility for inspecting table contents
- **Existence checks for Cryptid objects** - All compatibility functions gracefully skip if Cryptid isn't installed or objects don't exist yet

#### Jen Almanac (`Jen.lua`)
- **P03 Joker Enhancement** - Implemented dynamic exotic control:
  - `add_to_deck()` - Removes `cry_exotic` from POINTER:// blacklist when P03 is obtained
  - `remove_from_deck()` - Re-adds `cry_exotic` to blacklist when P03 is sold/removed
  - Makes P03's description text ("can now create Exotic Jokers") actually functional
- **Module-level Cryptid initialization** - Pointer blacklist and aliases setup runs immediately at mod load time for proper timing
- **process_loc_text integration** - Calls Encoded deck setup after all mods are loaded
- **Early compatibility init** - Gameset override and safety wrappers init during safety systems setup

#### Jen lovely.toml
- **Cryptid Compatibility Patches** - Added 3 patches for Cryptid integration:
  - **Code card fallback patch**: Changes default crash recovery card from `c_cry_crash` to `c_cry_oboe` (prevents crashes since crash card is banned)
  - **Profile prefix patch**: Changes Cryptid save profile prefix from "M" to "J" for Jen
  - **Tutorial auto-skip patch**: Automatically completes Cryptid intro and sets gameset to "madness"

### Changed

#### Load Order Optimization
- **Separated early and late initialization** - Gameset/safety wrappers run early, deck ownership runs late after all mods load
- **Module-level vs function-level execution** - Pointer setup runs at module load time instead of inside `process_loc_text()` for proper timing

### Fixed

#### Cryptid Encoded Deck
- **Crash on deck ownership before Cryptid loads** - Added existence check for `SMODS.Back.obj_buffer["b_cry_encoded"]` before attempting take_ownership
- **Copy/Paste joker spawning on Encoded deck** - Properly overrides deck behavior to only spawn Code Joker

#### POINTER:// System
- **Exotic joker control** - Cryptid handles exotic blacklist natively, P03 joker dynamically enables/disables exotic creation
- **Pointer functions not running** - Moved setup from `process_loc_text()` to module-level execution at file load time
- **Module availability timing** - Added comprehensive debug logging and checks for Cryptid function existence
- **P03 functional enhancement** - Original compat mod had non-functional P03 description; now actually controls exotic availability

### Removed

- **CryptidAlmanacCompat mod dependency** - All functionality successfully integrated into Jen/JenLib

## [16/11/2025]

### Fixed

#### Jen Almanac (`Jen/Jen.lua`, `lovely.toml`)
- **Retrigger Edition repetitions field typo**: Fixed Retrigger Edition returning `retriggers` instead of `repetitions` field in effect table, preventing log warnings during retrigger checks.
- **The Saint double trigger on Gateway**: Added `_saint_karma_done` flag check to prevent The Saint from triggering twice per Gateway consumable use, matching the pattern used by other Jokers like P03.
- **Ban system ignoring `disable_bans` config on save load**: Fixed save load patch in `lovely.toml` unconditionally calling `Jen:delete_hardbans()`, which deleted banned jokers from the pool regardless of the `disable_bans` config setting. Now correctly calls `init_cardbans()` which respects the config option.

---

## [15/11/2025]

### Fixed

#### Steamodded Core (`smods/src/overrides.lua`)
- **HUD_blind_debuff assertion crash on save load**: Added early guard check to `HUD_blind_debuff` callback to safely skip execution when `G.HUD_blind` is not yet initialized. This prevents crashes when loading saved runs during UI initialization phase.
- **Removed overly strict HUD_blind equality assertion**: The assertion that checked `G.HUD_blind == e.UIBox` could fail during legitimate UI states. The early guard at the function entry is now sufficient to prevent initialization issues.

#### Jen Almanac (`Jen/Jen.lua`)
- **Ban system crash on nil center objects**: Wrapped `Jen:delete_hardbans()` with proper error handling using `pcall` to safely handle cases where `SMODS.Center:get_obj()` returns nil or an object without a `delete` method.
- **Type checking for center deletion**: Added type validation to verify that center objects exist and have a `delete` method before invoking it, preventing nil method call errors.
- **Graceful degradation on deletion failure**: Failed card deletions now log a warning instead of crashing, allowing the banning system to continue functioning even if individual card deletions fail.

### Technical Details

**Root Causes Addressed:**
1. During save load initialization, the HUD_blind UI callback could be triggered before `G.HUD_blind` was fully initialized in the global state, causing assertion failures.
2. The ban system attempted to delete center objects (cards, consumables, blinds) that were in Jen's ban configuration but either didn't exist or weren't properly registered in Steamodded's registry.

**Impact:**
- Saves now load without crashing
- Banned cards are correctly removed from the game pool
- Game remains stable even if edge cases occur during card deletion
